  * rather than exceptions — because a caller can meaningfully degrade. Above `terminal` that claim had no end-to-end
  * coverage at all, because `HeadlessBackend` could not fail and `emergencyRestore` was named by no test in the
  * repository. The two halves covered here are the ones a user actually feels: a setup that dies half-way must still
  * hand the shell back, and a failure mid-run must end the run as a value rather than by unwinding past the restore.

    * `close()` *followed by* `emergencyRestore()` — is an ordering, not a state. So this is a fake of its own, in the
    * idiom `RunnerLifecycleSpec` already uses for the same reason.
    *
    * `readEvent` answers with `q` on every call, so a run that gets as far as its loop ends at the first event a
    * handler quits on instead of blocking the suite.
