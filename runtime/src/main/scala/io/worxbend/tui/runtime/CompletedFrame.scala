  * `buffer` is a snapshot, not the composer's live buffer. The composer reuses one buffer for as long as the terminal
  * keeps its size, so handing out the live one would give an observer a value that quietly changes underneath it on the
  * next frame. Retaining this snapshot is safe, and is the point.
  *
  * `count` is the same number the [[Frame]] carried: the first frame of a run is `0`. It counts *composed* frames, so a
  * frame the backend's diff turned into no output at all is still counted here.
  *
  * Handed to [[RunnerConfig.onFrame]] on the render thread, inside the frame it describes. Keep the body short and do
  * not block in it: the loop is not reading input while it runs.
