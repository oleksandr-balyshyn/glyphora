/** One frame being rendered: the drawable `area` plus the buffer widgets write into.
  *
  * The buffer itself stays module-private — application render code goes through the widget contract, which keeps every
  * write attributable to a widget and an area.
  *
  * `count` is how many frames this runner composed before this one: the first frame of a run is `0` and the number goes
  * up by one per composed frame, wrapping back to `0` after `Long.MaxValue` (about 300 million years at a thousand
  * frames a second — the wrap is stated so the type is total, not because anyone will see it). It counts *composed*
  * frames, not cells that reached the terminal: a frame the backend's diff turned into no output at all still consumed
  * its number. Use it to do expensive work only every Nth frame, or to label a frame in a debug overlay. Do **not**
  * drive animation from it — a frame rate is not a clock, and the same animation would then run at a different speed on
  * a fast terminal than on a slow one. `core.Progress` with a real elapsed duration is the one owner of
  * time-to-position arithmetic.

    *
    * One frame has one caret. A later call in the same frame replaces an earlier one, so the innermost element to claim
    * the cursor is the one that gets it, and a frame that never calls this leaves the cursor hidden. Coordinates are
    * buffer coordinates — the same space [[area]] and mouse events use, not an offset inside some widget.
