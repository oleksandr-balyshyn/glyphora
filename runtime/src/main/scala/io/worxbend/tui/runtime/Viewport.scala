/** How much of the terminal one run owns.
  *
  * [[Fullscreen]] is the takeover every glyphora app has had until now. The terminal has two screen buffers: the
  * *primary* one, which holds the shell's output and scrolls into scrollback, and the *alternate* one, a single
  * screenful with no history. A full-screen app switches to the alternate screen, paints over the whole of it, and
  * switches back on exit — so the user's shell output is hidden for the app's lifetime and comes back untouched
  * afterwards, and the app leaves no trace behind.
  *
  * [[Inline]] stays on the primary screen and owns only the bottom `height` rows of it. The shell's earlier output
  * stays visible above the app, and the app's last frame is still there after it exits, the way `git`'s output is. That
  * is the shape a progress panel, an installer, or a one-question prompt wants.
  *
  * These are terminal-space decisions, not widget-space ones: this picks the `Rect` a frame is composed into. Scrolling
  * *inside* a widget is a separate thing entirely and is unaffected.

    * are reachable from a user resizing their window, not just from a bad argument.
