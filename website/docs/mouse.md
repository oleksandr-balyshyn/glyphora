# Mouse & focus

Keyboard and mouse input meet in the same element tree. Focus determines where key
events begin; rendered rectangles determine where mouse events land. User handlers
run before built-in widget behavior, and an event can bubble toward its parent when
it is not consumed.

## How focus is built

On each render glyphora walks the current `Element` tree depth-first and records
focusable elements. Inputs, buttons, toggles, selects, lists, text areas, and other
interactive elements opt in automatically.

- `Tab` moves to the next focusable element;
- `Shift+Tab` moves to the previous one;
- clicking an interactive element focuses it first;
- the active theme's `focus` style decorates the focused element — and is also the
  selection highlight every list-like element draws with, whether or not it has focus;
- opening a modal removes everything below it from the tab order and from key and mouse routing.

Make any custom element focusable with `.focusable`:

```scala
panel("Custom control")(text("press Enter"))
  .focusable
  .onKey(Key.Enter) { activate() }
```

## Choose where focus starts

Focus starts on the first focusable in the tab order. `.autofocus` moves it to the
element that asks:

```scala
column(
  input(search, placeholder = "search").autofocus.key("search"),
  list(results, resultState),
)
```

It fires **once**, on the frame the element first appears in, and never again while the
element stays in the tree. That is deliberate: an element that re-claimed focus every
render would make `Tab` useless, because the next frame would take the keyboard straight
back. The same rule makes it work for content that appears later — open a dialog whose
default button carries `.autofocus` and the keyboard goes there as the dialog appears,
then stays wherever the user puts it.

`.autofocus` also opts the element into the tab order, the way `.focusable` does, so it
works on a non-interactive element too. Pair it with `.key(...)`: "has this element
appeared?" is answered by the focus key when there is one and by the element's position
in the tab order otherwise, so an unkeyed autofocusing element that *moves* — because
something above it appeared — reads as a new element and claims focus a second time. If
two elements ask at once, the first in the tab order wins.

## Keep focus stable across changing trees

Without an explicit key, focus is positional. Conditional content inserted before a
control can make the same numeric position refer to a different element. Assign a
stable identity when tree shape changes:

```scala
column(
  input(search, placeholder = "search").key("search"),
  if showAdvanced.get then input(pattern).key("advanced-pattern")
  else spacer(1),
  button("Apply") { apply() }.key("apply"),
)
```

During the next focus pass glyphora finds the same key in the new tree and moves the
focus index to it.

## Move focus from application code

The same key is how an app moves focus itself, alongside the `Tab` traversal and
click-to-focus the framework does on its own:

```scala
binding("ctrl+s", "save") {
  if !emailIsValid then
    notify("that email address is not valid", NoticeLevel.Warning)
    focusTo("email")      // put the cursor back on the offending field
  else save()
}
```

`focusTo(key)` answers `false` and changes nothing when no focusable carrying that key
was in the frame the app last rendered — which is what happens when the element sits in
a branch the view did not render, or when the key is misspelt. When it succeeds, the key
is remembered, so focus then *follows* that element across later renders the way a
`.key(...)` normally does.

`clearFocus()` is the other direction: it leaves nothing focused at all, so no element
renders with the focus cue and keys go straight past the tree to the app's bindings.
`Tab` from there lands on the first focusable and `Shift+Tab` on the last. `focusedKey`
reads back where focus currently is (`None` when the focused element is unkeyed, when
focus was cleared, or when the app is not running).

All three are no-ops outside a run, so calling one from a constructor is a `false`
rather than a crash.

## Use concise handlers for exact keys

`.onKey` consumes an event only when one of its keys matches and composes with other
`.onKey` calls:

```scala
panel("Counter")(text(count.get.toString))
  .onKey(Key.char('+'), Key.Up) { count.update(_ + 1) }
  .onKey(Key.char('-'), Key.Down) { count.update(_ - 1) }
  .onKey(Key.Home) { count.set(0) }
```

The `Key` vocabulary includes arrows, `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, paging and editing
keys, `f(1)` through `f(12)`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, and common constants such as
`CtrlS`, `CtrlP`, and `CtrlQ`.

## Use raw key events for conditional consumption

Drop to `.onKeyEvent` when you need the event's modifiers or want to decline it:

```scala
text("q quits only from this mode").onKeyEvent {
  case KeyEvent(KeyCode.Char('q'), _) if canQuit.peek =>
    quit()
    true
  case _ =>
    false // bubble to the parent, then app bindings
}
```

For the focused path, routing order is:

1. focused element's user handler;
2. focused element's built-in behavior;
3. each ancestor's user handler, inner to outer;
4. the app's `KeyBindings`;
5. built-ins such as `Tab`, `Ctrl+P`, and unconsumed `Ctrl+C`.

This lets an input consume normal text and editing keys while a parent still handles
`Escape` and the app still handles global commands.

## Use concise handlers for one kind of mouse event

Most mouse handling is "run this when the user clicks me", and writing that as a raw
`onMouseEvent` means repeating a `kind` test and a `true`/`false` every time. There is a
named builder for each kind, the mouse-side counterpart of `.onKey`:

```scala
row(text(label), text(count))
  .onClick { select(row) }                          // a press (MouseEventKind.Down)
  .onScroll(up = zoom.update(_ + 1), down = zoom.update(_ - 1))

panel("Canvas")(canvasView)
  .onClickAt(pos => selectedCell.set((pos.x, pos.y)))  // told which cell was pressed
  .onHover(pos => hovered.set(Some(pos)))              // pointer moved, no button held
  .onDrag(pos => stroke.update(pos :: _))              // pointer moved, button held
  .onDragEnd(_ => commitStroke())                      // the button came back up
```

Each one consumes only the kind it names and hands every other kind to a handler already
on the element, so several of them layer instead of the last one replacing the ones
before it — the same rule `.onKey` follows. `onScroll` takes both directions together on
purpose: a wheel that scrolls one way and not the other is a bug, and asking for both
makes forgetting one impossible.

Positions are absolute, zero-based terminal cells, the same coordinate space a `Rect`
uses; an element that wants its own coordinate space subtracts its area's origin.

`onHover` and `onDrag` depend on the terminal reporting motion. On terminals without
any-motion reporting the element simply never hears one, so a hover cue must never be
the only way to reach something.

Reach for the raw `onMouseEvent` below when a handler needs the whole event — its
keyboard modifiers, say — or when whether it consumes the event depends on the state.

## Handle custom mouse behavior

`MouseEvent` carries a `Position` (the absolute terminal cell the pointer was over), a
`MouseEventKind`, keyboard modifiers, and a `MouseButton`:

```scala
panel("Canvas")(canvasView).onMouseEvent {
  case MouseEvent(Position(x, y), MouseEventKind.Down, _, MouseButton.Left) =>
    selectedCell.set((x, y))
    true
  case MouseEvent(_, MouseEventKind.ScrollDown, _, _) =>
    zoom.update(value => math.max(1, value - 1))
    true
  case _ =>
    false
}
```

Kinds are `Down`, `Up`, `Drag`, `Moved`, `ScrollUp`, `ScrollDown`, `ScrollLeft`, and
`ScrollRight`. The last two are the horizontal wheel — what a sideways trackpad swipe
sends. No built-in element consumes them, because no widget in this library scrolls
sideways, so they bubble untouched all the way out and are yours to act on:

```scala
dataTable(columns, rows, tableState).onMouseEvent { event =>
  event.kind match {
    case MouseEventKind.ScrollLeft  => columnOffset.update(n => math.max(0, n - 1)); true
    case MouseEventKind.ScrollRight => columnOffset.update(_ + 1); true
    case _                          => false
  }
}
```

A vertical wheel notch over a list still moves its selection; a sideways one deliberately
does not, because a swipe is not a row move. The position is
in absolute screen cells and zero-based, the same coordinate space a `Rect` uses — so a
handler that wants coordinates relative to its own area subtracts that area's origin
(`event.position.x - area.x`). Custom widgets should compare the position with the
element's known model, or use built-in interactive elements when possible.

## Which button

`MouseButton` is `Left`, `Middle`, `Right`, or `Unknown`. Matching on it is how an
application tells a context-menu click apart from an ordinary one:

```scala
panel("Files")(fileList).onMouseEvent { event =>
  event.button match {
    case MouseButton.Right =>
      contextMenuAt.set(Some(event.position))
      true
    case MouseButton.Middle =>
      pasteSelection()
      true
    case _ =>
      false
  }
}
```

`Unknown` is not a failure case — it is what the terminal reports when the event names no
button at all. A wheel notch (`ScrollUp`/`ScrollDown`) presses nothing, and the legacy X10
mouse encoding has one "some button came up" release code that does not say which button it
was. Modern terminals negotiate the SGR encoding, which keeps the button identity on the
release as well as the press, so a right-button drag-and-release reports `Right` throughout.

Built-in click behavior — a `button`, a `checkbox`, a `toggle` — fires on `MouseButton.Left`
only. A right-click over one of those controls is left unconsumed and keeps bubbling, so your
own handler, or an ancestor's, can open a menu instead of the button firing underneath it.

## Built-in mouse behavior

You do not need custom handlers for common interactions:

| Element | Mouse behavior |
|---|---|
| input, list, select, controls | click focuses; click may position/select/activate |
| button, checkbox, toggle | click activates |
| list, menu, tree, directoryTree, selectionList, filePicker | wheel moves the selection one entry |
| log, scrollView | wheel changes the offset |
| slider | click or drag positions the value |
| split pane | drag moves the divider |

`dataTable` is the one selectable collection with no wheel behavior: its selection
indexes the visible page, so a wheel step would have to choose between moving inside
the page and turning it. PageUp/PageDown say which, and `.onMouseEvent` is there if a
particular table wants the wheel to do one of them.

A user `.onMouseEvent` runs first. Return `false` when the widget's built-in behavior
should still run.

## Mouse delivery order

Mouse events are delivered only to elements that actually rendered under the
pointer, innermost first: the deepest handler-carrying element under the pointer,
outward to the element the click resolved to, then that element's ancestors. At each
step the element's own `.onMouseEvent` runs first and its built-in behavior second,
so a **wheel** a built-in declines keeps travelling outward — that is how the wheel
still scrolls a `scrollView` when the pointer sits over a button inside it. Only the
wheel does that: scrolling targets the nearest scrollable ancestor, while a press or a
drag stays with the element it landed on, so dragging inside a `splitPane` pane does
not move the divider. An element's built-in only ever acts on a pointer inside that
element's own rendered area. Each handler sees a given event at most once — returning
`false` bubbles the event outward, it never redelivers it. A handler on an element the
pointer is not over is not called.

Where overlapping elements *carrying handlers* compete, the topmost one wins.
Containers paint children in order and `layers(base, overlays*)` paints later children
over earlier ones, so a click on an overlay goes to the overlay, not to the base drawn
underneath it. Focusable elements are resolved differently — by smallest covering area,
which has no notion of z-order — so give an overlay's controls their own layer rather
than relying on paint order to shadow a focusable beneath them.

## Hover and all-motion tracking

`Moved` — the pointer moving with **no** button held — is the one kind you do not get
by default. A terminal reports only the mouse activity it has been asked for, and the
default request is *button-event tracking*: presses, releases, the wheel, and motion
only while a button is down. Under that setting a terminal never sends a hover, so
`Moved` never arrives and `Drag` covers all motion you can see.

Asking for `MouseCaptureMode.AllMotion` adds the terminal mode that reports every
pointer movement over the window, which is what hover highlighting, tooltips and
drop-target previews need:

```scala
backend.enableMouseCapture(MouseCaptureMode.AllMotion)
```

It is opt-in because it is not free: the terminal sends a report for every cell the
pointer crosses, which costs nothing locally and is noticeable over a slow ssh link.
`MouseCaptureMode.Buttons` is the default and is what the no-argument
`enableMouseCapture()` requests.

## Backend support

`TuiApp` and `JLine3Backend` negotiate mouse capture for you. A custom runner owns
that backend lifecycle itself. Input decoding belongs in the backend—application
code should never parse escape sequences.

The backend asks the terminal for four modes: `1000` (press and release), `1002`
(motion while a button is held), `1015` and `1006`. The last two are *encodings* — the
original one writes each coordinate as a single byte and cannot name a column past
223, so both of the newer forms are requested and a terminal that understands the
better one (`1006`, which names which button was released) settles on it. Pixel
reporting (`1016`) is deliberately not requested: its coordinates are pixels, and
everything above the backend addresses cells. `MouseCaptureMode.AllMotion` adds mode
`1003` on top.

Headless tests can click exact cells and post any mouse kind. See
[Testing](./testing#test-mouse-and-resize) for examples, and
[Unicode & accessibility](./unicode-and-accessibility) for keyboard-equivalent and
