/** Discipline check for the golden-frame fixtures a module keeps on disk: every `golden/<name>.txt` file under a
  * module's test resources must be named by at least one `assertMatches("<name>", …)` or `assertGolden("<name>")` call
  * in that module's test sources.
  *
  * Why this exists: [[GoldenFrames]] already fails a test that names a fixture which is not there. The opposite
  * direction — a fixture file whose test was deleted or renamed — has no such alarm. The stale file keeps sitting in
  * the repository, keeps being reviewed as if it meant something, and quietly stops recording anything at all. One
  * suite per module calling [[assertNoOrphans]] closes that gap, the same way `DocumentedFactorySpec` closes the gap
  * between a public factory and the prose that is supposed to mention it.
  *
  * Why it reads the *source files* rather than counting assertions at run time: the build forks one JVM per test class
  * (`testForkGrouping` in `build.mill`), so no single process ever observes the names that every suite in the module
  * asserted. A registry filled in as tests run would see only its own class's names and call everything else an orphan.
  *
  * Ownership and threading: this object holds no state. It reads the two directories the caller hands it on the calling
  * thread, and is safe to call from several tests at once.
