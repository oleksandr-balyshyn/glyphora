  * about the toolkit. `ps` computes all of it, and the same command works on macOS, so more readers see live rows
  * instead of the fallback.
  *
  * The cost, stated plainly: `ps` reports `%cpu` as an average over each process's whole lifetime, not as a delta since
  * the last sample the way `top` does, so the numbers drift rather than jump. A real monitor would read
  * `/proc/<pid>/stat` twice and divide.
