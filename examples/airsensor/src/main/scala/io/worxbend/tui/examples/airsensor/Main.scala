/** airsensor: an indoor air-quality dashboard modelled on `worxbend/airgradient-cli`, polling a sensor on a timer and
  * mapping every reading onto a threshold band.
  *
  * What it teaches:
  *   - **Polling on a timer.** `Async.every` re-arms a background read; the continuation lands back on the render
  *     thread, which is the only place a `Signal` may be written.
  *   - **A loading → ready → error state machine.** A failed poll keeps the last good reading on screen and says so,
  *     rather than blanking the pane.
  *   - **Threshold bands.** Raw numbers become `Good`/`Moderate`/`Elevated`/`Unhealthy`, shown as *both* a colour and a
  *     word, because colour alone is not accessible.
  *   - **Metric cards.** One data-driven card shape — value, band, ramped bar, scale — reused for every metric.
  *   - **Trend arrows from a rolling history.** A bounded `Vector` in a `Signal`, with a dead band so the arrow reports
  *     the room rather than the sensor's jitter.
  *
  * Keys: `r` refresh now · `+` slower · `-` faster · `h` toggle history · `?` help · `q`/`Esc` quit.
