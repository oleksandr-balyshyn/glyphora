/** The two promises every widget in this module makes, asserted across the whole catalogue rather than for the handful
  * `DegenerateInputSpec` happens to name.
  *
  * A widget that throws out of `render` takes the render thread — and with it the application — down. A widget that
  * writes outside the `Rect` it was handed silently corrupts whatever its neighbour drew, because `Buffer.set` clips to
  * the *buffer* and knows nothing about the rectangle a widget was given. Neither promise had a test for most of the
  * widgets here, and the areas that break them are the ones a real terminal produces by ordinary means: a pane solved
  * to zero columns by a `Constraint`, a one-row status strip, a window dragged down to a couple of cells.
  *
  * Containment is checked on all four sides. `DegenerateInputSpec.spillToTheRight` renders at the buffer's own top-left
  * corner, so it can only ever see a rightward spill; here the widget's rect is inset into a larger frame pre-filled
  * with a sentinel cell, and every cell outside the rect must still hold that sentinel afterwards.
