/** What a widget does with content that does not fit the width it is given — used by [[Paragraph]] for its text and by
  * [[Notice]] for its message.
  *
  * This is a named choice rather than a `wrap: Boolean` because the two spellings read the same at a call site
  * (`Paragraph(text, wrap = false)` and `Paragraph(text, Overflow.Clip)` are the same picture) but only one of them
  * survives a reader who has never seen the parameter list: `true` says nothing about which behaviour is on.
  *
  * Three of the four cases wrap, and they differ in one decision only: what happens to the blanks at the head of a row.
  * That decision has no right answer, because it depends on whether the caller's indentation carries meaning. An
  * indented bullet list wrapped at width 12 shows all three:
  *
  * {{{
  * source text:   "  * a long bullet"
  *
  * Wrap           "  * a long"     the line's own indent is kept, the blank the break landed on is dropped
  *                "bullet"
  *
  * WrapTrimmed    "* a long"       every row starts flush against the left edge, indent included
  *                "bullet"
  *
  * WrapPreserved  "  * a long"     nothing is ever dropped, so the break blank re-indents the next row
  *                " bullet"
  * }}}
  *
  * Pick [[Wrap]] for a document whose indentation is structure and whose breaks are incidental — which is nearly
  * always. Pick [[WrapTrimmed]] for prose pasted in with an indent nobody wants on screen. Pick [[WrapPreserved]] when
  * the text is a rendering of something whitespace-significant and dropping a blank would misrepresent it.

    * width is broken inside, and then between grapheme clusters, so a wide character or emoji is never split.

    * [[io.worxbend.tui.core.Measured.heightAt]] reports.
