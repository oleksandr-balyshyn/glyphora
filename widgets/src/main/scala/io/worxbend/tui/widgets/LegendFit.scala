  * A key is only worth drawing while the data underneath it can still be read. Each axis carries a
  * [[io.worxbend.tui.core.Constraint]] that the legend's own demand on that axis has to satisfy; if either axis fails,
  * the caller drops the legend entirely, so a small pane degrades to a plain plot rather than to a key with no room
  * left for data.
  *
  * The rule lives here rather than inside one widget because more than one chart wants it and, like [[BlockLadder]], it
  * is the kind of arithmetic that is only worth correcting in one place.
  *
  * These are pure functions holding no state; a caller runs them on the render thread and inherits no constraint of its
  * own.
