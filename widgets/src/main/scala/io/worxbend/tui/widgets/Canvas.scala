/** How many drawable sub-pixels one terminal cell contributes to a [[Canvas]].
  *
  * The cases trade resolution against how likely a terminal's font is to have the glyphs. Roughly, in descending order
  * of safety: [[Cell]] and [[HalfBlock]] work everywhere, [[Quadrant]] and [[Braille]] work almost everywhere,
  * [[Sextant]] needs a font from 2020 or later, and [[Octant]] one from 2024 or later. A missing glyph shows as the
  * terminal's replacement box, so pick the finest resolution you are willing to see fail.
  *
  * Resolution is not the only difference. Braille draws *sparse dots* with gaps between them, which reads as a line;
  * the block-drawing cases fill their whole sub-pixel, which reads as a solid area. For a filled chart the block cases
  * look better even at the same dot count, which is why [[Octant]] exists next to [[Braille]] at the identical 2×4.

  * makes a label worth having over writing the text yourself next to the canvas: when the bounds change, the label
  * moves with the thing it names instead of staying where you put it.
  *
  * Text lands at whole-*cell* granularity whatever the [[CanvasResolution]] is, because there is no half of a cell for

  * `marker` is read only at [[CanvasResolution.Cell]], where there is one dot per cell; a marker that is not exactly
  * one column wide is replaced by [[Marker.Dot]] rather than allowed to smear into the next cell.
  *
  * `labels` breaks the "required data first" parameter order this repository otherwise keeps to, and does so
  * deliberately: it is an optional annotation layer rather than the canvas's subject, and putting it anywhere but last
  * would silently rebind the arguments of every positional `Canvas(...)` already written. Labels are drawn after every
