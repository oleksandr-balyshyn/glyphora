/** A month grid: an optional title row, an optional weekday header, and the day numbers, with an optional highlighted
  * day.
  *
  * `showTitle` and `showWeekdays` do more than blank a row — the row is not reserved at all, so a grid with neither
  * header starts its first week on the very first row of the area and needs two rows fewer. That is what makes a bare
  * month grid usable in a narrow sidebar.
  *
  * `showSurroundingDays` fills the leading and trailing cells of the grid with the days of the months either side,
  * drawn in `surroundingStyle` (dimmed by default) so they read as context rather than as part of this month. They
  * are never selectable: `selected` names a day of the month being shown.
  *
  * `firstDayOfWeek` decides which weekday the leftmost column is, so a US-facing application asks for
  * `DayOfWeek.SUNDAY` and gets a Sunday-first grid with the day numbers moved to match. `locale` decides the language
  * of the month name and the weekday abbreviations. It defaults to `Locale.ENGLISH` rather than to
  * `Locale.getDefault`, deliberately: a widget whose output depends on the machine it runs on cannot be tested by
  * comparing frames, and a caller who wants the machine's locale can pass `Locale.getDefault` and mean it.
  *
  * `dayStyles` gives individual dates their own appearance — a date with an appointment, a public holiday, today,
  * every day of a streak. It is keyed by `java.time.LocalDate` rather than by day-of-month so a caller can hold one map
  * across several months and hand the same value to each grid. A date's style is layered over the calendar's `style`,
  * and `highlightStyle` is layered over that in turn, so the cursor stays visible wherever it lands: a marked day that
  * is also the selected day reads as selected first.
  *
  * Needs 20 columns (seven three-column day slots, the last one two wide) and one row per header shown plus one row
  * per week the month touches — so up to 8 rows with both headers, and up to 6 with neither. Overflow clips like
  * everything else.
