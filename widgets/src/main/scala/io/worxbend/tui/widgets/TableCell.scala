/** One cell of a [[Table]] row, and how many columns it covers.
  *
  * A [[Table]] accepts either a bare [[Line]] — a cell in one column, which is all a cell could be before this type
  * existed — or a `TableCell`, and the two may be mixed in one row. That union is the same shape [[TableRow]] and
  * [[ListView]] use, so nothing written against the older signature has to change.
  *
  * A spanning cell is what a grouped header is made of. Given four columns, a header row of `TableCell(Line.raw("in"),
  * 2)`, `TableCell(Line.raw("out"), 2)` writes two captions each centred over its own pair of data columns. Without
  * spans the only way to draw that was a second `Table` stacked above the first with its own, hand-matched width
  * constraints — which drifted apart from the real ones the moment either was edited. A full-width note row inside the
  * body is the same trick with one cell and a span covering every column.
  *
  * @param content
  *   the cell's text, clipped to the merged width like any other cell. Never wrapped.
  * @param columnSpan
  *   how many solved columns this cell covers, counting from wherever it lands in its row. The gaps `columnSpacing`
  *   puts between those columns are covered too, because the point is one continuous run of cells rather than several
  *   with holes. Clamped to at least one, and to no more than the columns actually remaining in the row: a span that
  *   ran off the end would either draw outside the table's area or, worse, silently swallow the cells after it.
