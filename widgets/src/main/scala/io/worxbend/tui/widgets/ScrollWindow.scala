  /** The offset to render at: `offset` clamped so the window never runs past the end of the content, then nudged by the
    * smallest amount that brings `selected` back inside it.
    *
    * Nudging by the minimum is what makes a one-row keyboard move scroll by one row instead of re-centering the view.
    * With no selection the clamped offset stands, so scrolling a list nobody has selected in still works.
    *
    * `padding` widens what "inside the window" means. With the default of zero the selection may sit on the very first
    * or very last visible row, which is the classic "the cursor is welded to the bottom line" feel: the reader cannot
    * see what is coming next. With `padding = 2` the window is nudged so that two further rows of content stay visible
    * on each side of the selection whenever the content has that much to show, so pressing "down" starts scrolling the
    * list underneath a cursor that has stopped two rows short of the edge.
    *
    * Two clamps keep that well behaved. The padding itself is capped at `(viewportHeight - 1) / 2`, because a padding
    * bigger than half the window would ask for more rows above and below the selection than the window holds, and the
    * two demands would then fight each other into an oscillation from frame to frame. And the resulting offset is
    * clamped back into `0 .. total - viewportHeight`, so near either end of the content — where there is nothing left
    * to reveal — the selection does reach the edge row rather than the list scrolling past its own contents.

  /** The offset to render at when the items are not all the same height — [[offsetFor]]'s counterpart for a list whose
    * rows come in blocks, such as a [[ListView]] carrying multi-line items.
    *
    * `heights` is one row count per item, in order, and the answer is still an *item* index, not a row: the caller
    * slices its items with it exactly as it would with [[offsetFor]]. The rule is the same one — clamp, then nudge by
    * the smallest amount that brings the selection into view — expressed in rows rather than in indices:
    *
    *   - the offset is clamped to the last item at which the remaining items still fill the viewport, so the list never
    *     scrolls past its own end and leave blank rows below with content above;
    *   - with a selection above the window, the window moves up to start at the selection;
    *   - with a selection whose last row falls below the window, the offset advances one item at a time until the
    *     selection's last row fits, stopping at the selection itself so an item taller than the whole viewport still
    *     shows its top rather than scrolling off entirely.
    *
    * With every height equal to one this returns exactly what [[offsetFor]] with no padding returns; a list of uniform
    * items cannot tell the two apart. Padding has no counterpart here on purpose: "keep two more items visible" is not
    * a fixed number of rows when items differ in height, so a caller that wants it should reach for [[offsetFor]] on a
    * uniform list rather than get a rule that means something different on every frame.
