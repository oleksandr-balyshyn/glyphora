/** Blanks every cell of its area, so whatever is drawn after it sits on a clean background.
  *
  * This is the first half of the popup idiom. A dropdown, toast, autocomplete list or dialog drawn over an
  * already-composed frame would otherwise show the content underneath through its own gaps — a menu row shorter than
  * the popup is wide leaves the page text visible to the right of it. Render `Clear` into the popup's rect first, then
  * render the popup into the same rect.
  *
  * `style` is what the blanks carry: [[Style.Default]] erases to the terminal's own background, while a style with a
  * background colour paints an opaque panel. Only the area given to `render` is touched, and only the part of it that
  * falls inside the buffer; everything else is left exactly as it was.
  *
  * The widget owns no state and claims no size — it fills whatever rect it is handed, which is why it composes with any
  * container.
