/** When a list reserves the gutter its highlight symbol is drawn in.
  *
  * A list draws a marker — `"> "` by default — to the left of the selected row. The columns that marker occupies have
  * to come from somewhere, and the three answers below differ in when they are taken away from the text.
  *
  *   - [[Always]] reserves the gutter on every row whether or not anything is selected, so the text never moves
  *     sideways. This is what every list in this library did before the choice existed, and it is the default for that
  *     reason.
  *   - [[WhenSelected]] reserves it only while something is selected. A list nobody has selected in yet uses its full
  *     width for text, and the text shifts right by the marker's width the first time a row is highlighted. In a narrow
  *     pane those two reclaimed columns are worth the shift.
  *   - [[Never]] reserves nothing and draws no marker at all. Use it when the highlight *style* — a reversed or
  *     coloured row — is the only cue wanted, which is the usual choice for a list inside a bordered panel where every
  *     column counts.
  *
  * An enum rather than two booleans, because "reserve the gutter" and "draw the marker" are not independent: reserving
  * nothing and still drawing the marker would push the marker over the text.
  *
  * These are plain values with no state, so they carry no thread constraint of their own.
