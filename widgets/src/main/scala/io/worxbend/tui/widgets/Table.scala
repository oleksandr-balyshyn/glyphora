/** Rows of cells laid out in columns sized by the core constraint solver.
  *
  * Cells are never wrapped, and rows past the area's bottom edge are clipped, matching the library-wide silent-clipping
  * philosophy.
  *
  * @param rows
  *   each row is either a bare sequence of cells — one terminal line tall — or a [[TableRow]], which adds a height, top
  *   and bottom margins, and a per-row style. A cell in either shape is a [[Line]] covering one column, or a
  *   [[TableCell]] covering several. All the shapes may appear in the same table; see [[TableRow]] and [[TableCell]]
  *   for what the extra room and the spans are for.
  *
  * @param widths
  *   one [[Constraint]] per column. An empty sequence means "equal columns": the table counts the cells in the header
  *   and in the rows it is about to draw, and gives each column an equal share of the area. That fallback exists
  *   because an empty sequence used to render a blank rectangle, and the DSL's `table(rows)` — whose widths are
  *   varargs, so writing none of them is a legal call — landed straight in it.
  * @param footer
  *   an optional summary row — a totals line, a "last updated" note — pinned to the *bottom* of the area rather than
  *   following the last data row. Pinning it is the point: a table whose rows do not fill the area would otherwise
  *   leave the totals floating in the middle of the pane. It is laid out on the same solved columns as the body, which
  *   is what a separate `Table` stacked underneath could never guarantee — the moment the widths changed, the two
  *   drifted apart. It costs one row of body height. On an area one row tall that already has a header there is no
  *   bottom row left to pin it to, so the header wins and the footer is dropped.
  * @param footerStyle
  *   the style the footer row is drawn in, bold by default, matching the header.
  * @param flex
  *   where the columns sit when they do not fill the area. Constraints like `Length(8)` can leave the table narrower
  *   than the space it was given; before this parameter the leftover always trailed off the right-hand side, because
  *   the widget passed no flex to the layout and took the [[Flex.Start]] default. Now a table of fixed-width columns
  *   can be centred or right-aligned in its area, the same way a `row` can. Has no effect when a `Fill` or `Min` column
  *   is already absorbing the leftover, because then there is none.
