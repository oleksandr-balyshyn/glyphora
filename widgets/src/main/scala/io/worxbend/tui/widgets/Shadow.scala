  * instead, which is the right choice on a terminal that renders the dim attribute as nothing at all — a good many do.

  * immutable value that knows how to repaint a band of an existing [[Buffer]]; it is not a
  * [[io.worxbend.tui.core.Widget]] of its own, because a shadow is never the thing being drawn — it is something a
  * widget such as [[Block]] casts.
  *
  * `offsetX` and `offsetY` say how far the shadow is displaced, in cells. Positive values put it to the right and
  * below, which is what a light source at the top left produces and what nearly every interface means by a drop shadow;
  * negative values put it to the left and above. Zero on both axes means no shadow at all, and painting one is then a
  * no-op rather than an error.
  *
  * Rendering only ever writes into `bounds` and never into `box` itself, so the widget that casts the shadow can draw
  * itself afterwards without having to repair anything.
  *
  * Renders into a `Buffer` and nothing else, so it carries the buffer's thread constraint: paint from the thread that
  * owns the buffer.
