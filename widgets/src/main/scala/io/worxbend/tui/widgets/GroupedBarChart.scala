/** Upright bars clustered into labelled groups — the chart for comparing the same handful of series across several
  * categories, where [[BarChart]] compares one series across them.
  *
  * Every group is laid out identically: its bars sit `barGap` columns apart, and `groupGap` columns separate one group
  * from the next. A group's label is written centred underneath it on the area's last row, so it has the whole group's
  * width to fit in rather than one bar's — which is the practical reason to reach for this widget even for a single
  * series with long category names.
  *
  * The scale is shared by every bar in the chart, not computed per group. A bar's height is only readable against the
  * bars beside it if they are all measured against the same ceiling; `max` sets that ceiling explicitly, and otherwise
  * it is the largest value anywhere in the data.
  *
  * A group that does not fit wholly inside the area is dropped rather than half-drawn, the same rule [[BarChart]]
  * follows for a bar: a clipped group would show bars whose heights cannot be compared with their neighbours'.
  *
  * Renders into the [[io.worxbend.tui.core.Buffer]] it is handed and nothing else, so it carries the usual widget
  * thread constraint: call it from the render thread that owns the buffer.
