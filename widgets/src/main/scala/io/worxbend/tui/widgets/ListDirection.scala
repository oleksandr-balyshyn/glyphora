/** Which edge of its area a list is anchored to, and which way its rows run from there.
  *
  * [[TopToBottom]] is the ordinary reading order: the first visible item is drawn on the top row of the area and the
  * rest follow downward, so a list shorter than its area leaves the space underneath it empty.
  *
  * [[BottomToTop]] anchors to the opposite edge: the first visible item is drawn on the *last* row of the area and the
  * rest climb upward, so a short list sits against the floor of its area and the empty space ends up above it. That is
  * the shape a chat transcript or a log tail wants — the entry the reader cares about most stays welded to the bottom
  * edge instead of floating in the middle of a half-empty pane. Because the first item of the sequence lands on the
  * bottom row, a caller using this direction feeds its items newest-first.
  *
  * This is an enum rather than a `reversed: Boolean` parameter for the reason the style guide gives for preferring a
  * sealed type over a flag: at the call site `ListDirection.BottomToTop` says what it does where `true` would not, and
  * a third anchoring rule could be added later without changing the parameter's type.
  *
  * These are plain values with no state, so they carry no thread constraint of their own.
