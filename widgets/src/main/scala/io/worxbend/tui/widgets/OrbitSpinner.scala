/** A figure drawn at sub-cell resolution with a bright arc chasing round it, from how long the animation has been
  * running.
  *
  * The block-shaped counterpart to [[Spinner]]: where a one-cell spinner has to say "working" inside a single glyph,
  * this has an area to say it in, so it is what a full-screen "connecting…" pane wants and what a status line does not.
  * Like every animation here the frame is a pure function of `elapsed` — no state between renders, no clock read inside
  * `render`, so a test renders any moment directly and an app with no `tickRate` shows a legible first frame.
  *
  * `radius` is in DOTS, not cells, because that is the resolution the shape is drawn at — a radius in cells could not
  * express the difference between the two smallest legible rings. Left unset the figure fills its area, staying round:
  * an extreme aspect ratio yields a small centred ring rather than a squashed one, because a squashed circle reads as a
  * wobble rather than as a rotation.
  *
  * `sweep` is the fraction of the lap that is lit, not a dot count. A dot count makes the arc's apparent angle change
  * with radius, which keeps `radius` and arc length from being independent knobs.
  *
  * `resolution` and `marker` are the pair [[Canvas]] already ships, and reusing them is what gives this widget an ASCII
  * floor: `CanvasResolution.Cell` with `marker = "*"` draws the same figure at a quarter of the vertical resolution on
  * a terminal with no braille block. `marker` is read at that resolution only.
  *
  * ONE STYLE PER CELL — the constraint this widget is shaped around. A braille cell packs eight dots and carries one
  * [[Style]], so dot resolution is 2x4 per cell while *colour* resolution is 1 per cell. Two rules follow, both chosen
  * rather than fallen into. Masks are OR-ed, so a cell holding both arc and path dots keeps every dot and the resting
  * path never erodes. Styles take the brightest dot in the cell, so such a cell reads as arc: the head is never
  * overwritten by its own tail, and the quantisation error runs in one predictable direction — a cell can read brighter
  * than it should, never dimmer, so the arc never appears to break. The budget, measured rather than estimated: the
  * default radius-4 braille ring is 24 dots but only 11 cells, so a ramped comet shows 11 shades, not 24 (5 at the
  * default sweep), and `thickness` buys geometry rather than colour. The alternative — one dot per cell, so colour and
  * geometry agree — throws away the resolution braille was chosen for, and is rejected.
  *
  * The consequence worth knowing before reaching for this on a monochrome terminal: because the mask never erodes, the
  * *glyphs* are a pure function of the geometry and the whole animation lives in the per-cell style. A golden frame
  * must therefore assert styles, not glyphs, and a terminal rendering neither colour nor dim shows a static ring.
