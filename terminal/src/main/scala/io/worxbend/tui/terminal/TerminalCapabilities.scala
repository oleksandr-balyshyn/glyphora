  * usually still honours the mode, so switching a feature off on silence would disable synchronised output and
  * bracketed paste on the majority of terminals that answer nothing. Only an explicit [[Support.No]] — a mode report
  * that came back saying "not recognised" — turns anything off.

  * Three reply shapes matter, all of them CSI sequences whose parameters begin with `?`:
  *   - **DECRPM**, `CSI ? mode ; state $ y` — the answer to "is this DEC private mode recognised?". `state` is 0 for
  *     "not recognised" and 1/2/3/4 for set, reset, permanently set and permanently reset. Only 0 is a [[Support.No]].
  *   - **Kitty keyboard**, `CSI ? flags u` — sent only by a terminal that implements the protocol, so its arrival is
  *     the answer and its contents do not matter.
  *   - **DA1**, `CSI ? … c` — the primary device attributes reply. Every terminal answers it, which is what makes it
  *     the fence: terminals answer queries in the order they arrived, so once DA1 is back, anything still unanswered
  *     was never going to be answered.
