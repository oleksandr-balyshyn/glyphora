/** The query/reply round trips of [[JLine3Backend]]: asking the terminal something with an escape sequence and reading
  * its answer off the input stream.
  *
  * Every round trip has the same shape. The request goes out under the backend's `screenOwnership` monitor, like every
  * other write, so a Ctrl+Z handover cannot land between the question and the terminal. The *read* deliberately runs
  * outside that monitor: a read holding it for the length of the timeout would block the signal handler that hands the
  * terminal back on Ctrl+Z — exactly the key a user reaches for when something seems stuck. What protects the decoder
  * from a second reader is the render-thread contract in [[Backend.queryCursorPosition]], not the monitor.
  *
  * `emit` is the backend's monitored, flushing write, injected the way [[TitleStack]] receives it: this class owns no
  * writer and no flush logic of its own, so there is one definition of "a sequence went out" rather than one per
  * collaborator. A throw from it propagates to the caller, which wraps the round trip in [[Backend.attempt]] exactly as
  * it did when the write lived here.
  *
  * A terminal that does not implement a query never answers, so every read is bounded by a timeout and a silence is
  * reported as "unknown" (`None`, or [[TerminalCapabilities.unknown]] from [[probeCapabilities]]), never as an I/O
  * failure: nothing broke, the terminal simply cannot say.
