  * The rungs run from most to least capable. [[Monochrome]] and [[NoColor]] are the two ways of coping with a terminal
  * that cannot show a palette, and they are not the same thing:
  *   - [[Monochrome]] still emits color codes, but every color is thresholded to black or white by how bright it is. A
  *     selection that is conveyed only by a background color stays visible, which is what a two-tone terminal — or a
  *     black-and-white screen capture of a colorful app — needs.
  *   - [[NoColor]] is not a device capability but an explicit opt-out: when it is in effect the backend emits text
  *     attributes (bold, underline, …) but no foreground/background color at all. It is what honoring the `NO_COLOR`
  *     convention resolves to.
  *
  * Nothing in the environment ever resolves to [[Monochrome]]; it is opt-in, by overriding the application's
  * `colorDepth`.

    *      the output is not a TTY.
    *   3. `TERM=dumb` resolves to [[NoColor]]: by convention such a terminal understands no escape sequences at all, so
    *      a `COLORTERM` inherited from an outer terminal must not resurrect color.
    *   4. Otherwise `COLORTERM=truecolor|24bit` wins (subject to the corrections in [[capability]]), a `256color`
    *      `TERM` falls back to the 256 palette, and everything else to the classic 16.
    *   5. An unset or empty `TERM` with no `COLORTERM` signal resolves to [[NoColor]]: that is what output redirected
    *      into a file looks like from inside the process.
    *
    * A `CLICOLOR_FORCE` lifts steps 3 and 5 too: if the environment would otherwise say "no color at all", forcing
    * color on yields the classic sixteen.

    * then mangle every RGB escape instead of showing an approximation:
    *   - macOS `Terminal.app` (`TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal`) only gained 24-bit SGR support in build 465. An older
    *     build, or a build number this code cannot read, is capped at the 256 palette.
    *   - Inside `screen` or `tmux` the multiplexer passes the outer terminal's `COLORTERM` through without necessarily
    *     being able to honor it. Such a session is capped at the 256 palette unless its own `TERM` says otherwise
    *     (`tmux-direct`, `screen-truecolor`, …), which is the documented way of saying the multiplexer was configured
    *     to pass 24-bit color through.
    *
    * All comparisons lower-case with `Locale.ROOT` rather than the default locale. Under a Turkish locale
    * `"24BIT".toLowerCase` is `"24bıt"` with a dotless i, so `contains("24bit")` fails and a true-colour terminal is
    * silently downgraded to sixteen colours — every RGB style in the app flattens to the nearest named colour because
    * of the user's language setting.
