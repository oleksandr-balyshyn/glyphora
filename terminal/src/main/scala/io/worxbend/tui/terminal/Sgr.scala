    * of whatever came before can leak through. That is always correct, and it is expensive. A run of cells that differs
    * from its neighbour only in the bold flag still rewrites both truecolour colours — roughly thirty bytes where five
    * would do. Over a link where bytes cost time (ssh, mosh, a serial console) that is the largest remaining per-frame
    * cost after the frame diff itself.

    * the style it last emitted on this frame; no other caller should use it. Returns the empty string when the two
    * styles render identically — including when they differ only in a field SGR does not carry, such as the hyperlink.

    *     emitted in the first place, so a change to it is not a difference at all.
    *   - The `4:0` styled-underline selector has the same patchy support, so any change of [[UnderlineStyle]] — into,
    *     out of, or between the styled forms — takes the absolute path.
    *   - SGR 24 ("no underline") clears the styled underline along with the plain one. So switching the plain
    *     [[Modifiers.Underline]] flag on or off while a styled underline is in force would silently take the style with
    *     it; that combination also takes the absolute path.
