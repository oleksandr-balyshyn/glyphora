/** The shape the terminal draws its own hardware cursor in — DECSCUSR, `CSI n SP q` (XTerm `ctlseqs.ms`, "Set cursor
  * style").
  *
  * What it is for: a modal editor shows a block cursor in its command mode and a bar in its insert mode, and that
  * difference is how the user knows which mode they are in without reading a status line. This is the shape of the
  * *hardware* caret — the one an input method editor anchors its candidate popup to and a screen reader reports as the
  * insertion point — not of a highlighted cell a widget paints into a `Buffer`.
  *
  * [[Default]] hands the shape back to whatever the user configured in their terminal. It is what
  * `AnsiSequences.RestoreAll` emits, so a process killed mid-edit does not leave a bar cursor behind in the shell it
  * came from. A terminal that does not implement DECSCUSR ignores the sequence, so asking for a shape is never an
  * error, merely sometimes without effect.
