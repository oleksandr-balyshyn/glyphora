/** Reads the environment for how far up [[io.worxbend.tui.core.GlyphSupport]] this terminal can be trusted to go.
  *
  * The terminal-facing half of the glyph floor, deliberately separate from the value itself: `GlyphSupport` lives in
  * `tui-core` so widgets can honour it, and nothing in `tui-core` is allowed to know that terminals exist.
  *
  * Pure with respect to its argument — it reads only the `env` map it is handed, which defaults to `sys.env` — so a
  * test names an environment instead of mutating the process's own.

  /** The glyph floor this environment justifies.
    *
    * Precedence, highest first:
    *   1. `GLYPHORA_ASCII` set to any value other than empty or `0` forces [[GlyphSupport.Ascii]]. This is the escape
    *      hatch for a terminal that claims more than it can draw — a font with no braille coverage, say, where the
    *      spinner comes out as a row of replacement boxes.
    *   2. A character encoding that is not UTF-8 (or no locale variable at all) means the bytes cannot even survive the
    *      trip, so [[GlyphSupport.Ascii]]. `LC_ALL` wins over `LC_CTYPE`, which wins over `LANG`, which is the ordering
    *      POSIX defines for them.
    *   3. A Linux virtual console or a `vt`-class `TERM` gets [[GlyphSupport.BoxDrawing]]: its built-in font has the
    *      box-drawing block and nothing beyond it.
    *   4. Everything else gets [[GlyphSupport.Full]].
    *
    * There is deliberately no variable that forces the floor *up*. [[GlyphSupport.Full]] is already what any UTF-8
    * environment resolves to, so an opt-in would only ever be used to overrule rule 2 or 3 — and both of those describe
    * terminals that genuinely cannot draw the glyphs.
