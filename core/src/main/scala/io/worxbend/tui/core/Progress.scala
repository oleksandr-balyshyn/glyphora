/** Where an animation is at a given `elapsed` — the one place that turns time into position.
  *
  * Two flavours of the same question, deliberately kept side by side so they cannot drift apart:
  *
  *   - [[normalized]] is the '''one-shot''' answer: a fraction that runs past 1 once the animation is over. [[Tween]]
  *     and the timed [[Effect]]s use it, then hand it to an [[Easing]], which clamps.
  *   - [[stepped]] and [[steppedAtRate]] are the '''looping''' answers: a whole position in `0 until steps` that wraps
  *     round and round forever. The animated widgets (`Marquee`, `IndeterminateBar`, the spinners) use those.
  *
  * `stepped` is exactly `floor(normalized * steps)` folded into one cycle, only evaluated in integer arithmetic so that
  * a sample taken at an exact fraction of the period lands on the step that fraction names rather than one below it.
  *
  * All three are pure functions of the time they are handed: they hold no clock, so the caller owns the clock. See
  * [[Effect]] for what that means in a render loop.
