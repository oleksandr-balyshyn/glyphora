/** How much room a [[Layout]] leaves between two adjacent segments.
  *
  * `Gap(cells)` inserts that many empty cells between them, which is what `Layout`'s plain `spacing: Int` has always
  * done. `Overlap(cells)` does the opposite: it pulls each segment back over the one before it so the two *share* that
  * many columns or rows.
  *
  * Overlap is what lets two bordered blocks sit side by side sharing a single border line, instead of drawing two
  * adjacent lines with a doubled-up look — the "collapsed borders" style of a table or a grid. Draw the left block into
  * the first segment and the right one into the second, and the right block's left border lands exactly on the left
  * block's right border.
  *
  * Both cases clamp a negative argument to zero: the direction is carried by which case you chose, never by the sign of
  * the number. That is deliberate. `Layout`'s `spacing: Int` field clamps a negative value to zero for the same reason
  * — a caller who wrote `spacing = -2` almost certainly meant a typo, not a request to overlap — and this type exists
  * so that asking for an overlap is something you say out loud rather than something you get by accident.
