  * alignment of its own still overrules it for that one row, so the resolution order a renderer follows is: the line's
  * alignment first, then the text's, then the widget's own argument.
  *
  * `style` is this text's base style, the outermost of the three layers that decide how a character is drawn — the
  * text's style, then the [[Line]]'s, then the [[Span]]'s, each laid over the last with [[Style.patch]] so the more
  * specific layer wins wherever it speaks and the outer one shows through wherever it stays silent. The widget's own
  * style sits underneath all three. The default, [[Style.Default]], sets nothing, so a text that does not use it
  * renders exactly as it did before the layer existed.
