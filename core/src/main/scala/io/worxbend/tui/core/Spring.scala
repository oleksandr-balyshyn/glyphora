/** A damped-spring integrator (à la Charm's Harmonica) for physical, non-linear motion — scrolling, progress fills,
  * layout transitions.
  *
  * Unlike an [[Easing]], a spring has no fixed duration: call [[step]] each tick with the current position and velocity
  * and it eases toward `target`, overshooting or settling per `frequency` (stiffness) and `damping` (`< 1` bouncy, `1`
  * critically damped, `> 1` sluggish). Integrated semi-implicitly, stable for the usual TUI tick rates.
  *
  * `deltaTime` must be positive: a spring with a non-positive step can never advance, so the documented
  * `while !settled(...) do step(...)` loop would hang. A defect in the caller, hence a construction-time throw.
