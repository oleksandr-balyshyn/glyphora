/** How adventurous the glyphs written into a [[Buffer]] are allowed to be.
  *
  * The three rungs run floor to ceiling: each one permits everything the rungs below it permit. They are a *floor*, not
  * a measurement — nothing here can interrogate the font a terminal is drawing with, so a rung says "do not go above
  * this", never "this is definitely renderable".
  *
  *   - [[Ascii]] — nothing above U+007E. What survives a non-UTF-8 locale, a serial console, or a log file that someone
  *     will later open in an editor that is not a terminal at all.
  *   - [[BoxDrawing]] — the U+2500 box-drawing block on top of that. Present in essentially every fixed-width font,
  *     including the Linux virtual console's built-in one, which is why it is a rung of its own.
  *   - [[Full]] — anything glyphora draws, braille spinners and emoji included. The default, because a modern terminal
  *     emulator with a UTF-8 locale renders all of it.
  *
  * A pure value with no environment reading of its own: `tui-terminal`'s `TerminalGlyphs.detect` is what turns an
  * environment into one of these, and it lives up there so that this type — and therefore `tui-widgets` — stays free of
  * any notion of a terminal.
