/** Locks down what the constraint solver currently produces for a wide matrix of inputs.
  *
  * The other layout suites state the rules a reader is meant to learn; this one exists so that restructuring the solver
  * cannot quietly change a single cell. Each line of `layout-characterisation.txt` records one case as
  * `label => x+width,x+width,...`, so a diff points straight at the constraint set, extent, spacing and flex that
  * changed.
  *
  * Regenerating the file is only correct when a behaviour change is intended and explained. To do it, run the suite
  * with the same environment variable the golden-frame fixtures use, naming the resources directory to write into:
  *
  * {{{
  * GLYPHORA_GOLDEN_UPDATE=core/src/test/resources ./mill core.test.testOnly io.worxbend.tui.core.LayoutCharacterisationSpec
  * }}}
  *
  * The recording run compares nothing and says so on stderr; the next plain run is what checks the new file. Writer and
  * reader share [[record]], so a re-recorded file cannot drift into a format the reader no longer parses. (`core`
  * cannot depend on `test-support`, where `GoldenFrames` lives, so the behaviour is reproduced here rather than
  * reused.)
