/** Mechanical enforcement of rules this project states in prose and, until now, checked nowhere.
  *
  * The repository already trusts this shape: `ci.yml` greps every main source for `java.lang.reflect` and for
  * `String.substring`, each with a named exemption and the argument for it written down, and
  * [[DocumentedFactorySpec]]/[[DocumentedKeySpecSpec]] walk the checkout from a test to hold the published prose to the
  * code. What those checks have in common is that the rule they enforce is one a reviewer would otherwise have to
  * remember — and the failures they catch are silent: nothing is red, the suite is simply not testing what its name
  * claims. Each rule below is one this repository has already been bitten by:
  *
  *   - a suite that asserts nothing still reports as a passing test. Twenty-one performance probes were written as
  *     `*Spec` classes with a `test(…)` body and no assertion in it, and every one of them was green for as long as it
  *     existed. They have since been deleted; this is the gate that stops the next twenty.
  *   - `println` from a suite writes to the forked JVM's stdout rather than into the run's report, where `info(…)` puts
  *     it.
  *   - the seven published modules take their coordinates from one `publishVersion`. A module that overrode it, or a
  *     README that offered an older one, would be found by whoever tried the install instructions.
  *   - a bare `toLowerCase`, or `%d`/`%.1f` through the `f` interpolator, reads the *ambient* locale: `"Insert"` folds
  *     to `"ınsert"` under `tr-TR` and matches nothing, and `4.1` prints as `"4,1"` across much of Europe. Eight of
  *     those were fixed before this suite existed, each one found by hand.
  *   - `GLYPHORA_GOLDEN_UPDATE` turns every `GoldenFrames.assertMatches` in the process from a comparison into a
  *     recording. A run that leaks it is a run where the golden suites pass without looking at anything.
  *
  * It lives in `dsl.test` and scans the whole checkout rather than sitting once per module, for the same reason
  * [[GoldenFixtureDisciplineSpec]] does: one suite that walks the repository cannot be forgotten when a new module is
  * added. It reads sources as text — no `java.lang.reflect`, and no `String.substring` either, which is the rule
  * [[scan]] would otherwise be the most tempted by.
