/** Fails when a checked-in golden-frame fixture is named by no test any more.
  *
  * `GoldenFrames` already fails a test that asks for a fixture which is not on disk. The opposite mistake — deleting or
  * renaming the test and leaving its `golden/<name>.txt` behind — is invisible without a check like this one, and the
  * stale file then sits in the repository looking like it still guards something.
  *
  * It lives in `dsl.test` and scans *every* module rather than sitting once per module, for the same reason
  * [[DocumentedFactorySpec]] does: one suite that walks the checkout cannot be forgotten when a new module starts
  * recording fixtures.
