/** The running application's cross-cutting services, as a value a helper written outside the app object can be handed.
  *
  * Everything an application can *do* to itself — raise a toast, push a screen, open the command palette, run a
  * post-render effect, ask for a repaint, copy to the clipboard, quit — is a `protected` method on `TuiApp`, reachable
  * only from inside the app's own body. A view helper in another file therefore either takes one callback per action or
  * gives up and moves back into the app.
  *
  * This is that whole set as one value. It extends [[Notifications]], so a helper that only needs to notify can ask for
  * the narrower type and a helper that navigates can ask for this one:
  *
  * {{{
  * def statusFooter(using ReactiveScope, Theme, AppServices): Element =
  *   row(
  *     button("Settings")(summon[AppServices].pushScreen(settingsScreen)),
  *     button("Quit")(summon[AppServices].quit()),
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * `TuiApp` publishes its own as a `given`, so a call made from any method of the app resolves it with nothing to write
  * at the call site.
  *
  * Ownership and threads: an instance belongs to one `TuiApp` and every method on it must be called on that app's
  * render thread — which every event handler, timer body and `Async` continuation already is. Background work must call
  * `RenderThread.capture()` before going async, exactly as it must to touch a `Signal`.

    * renders one element and prints it, where there is no app to delegate to. This fills that gap the way
    * `Theme.default` fills it for styling: every method is a no-op, so the element builds and renders and none of its
    * handlers can do anything. It is deliberately silent rather than failing — construction is not the moment to find
    * out that an action would have had nowhere to go.
