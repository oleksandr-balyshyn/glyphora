  * it names and hands every other kind to a handler already on the element, so several of them compose instead of
  * overwriting each other — the same layering rule `onKey` follows. Reach for [[Element.onMouseEvent]] directly when a
  * handler needs the raw event, its modifiers, or conditional consumption.
  *
  * Positions are absolute, zero-based terminal cells — the same coordinate space a `Rect` uses — because that is what a
  * `MouseEvent` carries. An element that wants coordinates relative to its own area subtracts that area's origin.
  *
  * Like the key handlers and the styling builders, each one hands back the element's own type, so the node-specific
