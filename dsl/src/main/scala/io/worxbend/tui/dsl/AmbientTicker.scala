  /** Turns this run's own repeating tick on, off, or onto a different interval, according to what the frame just
    * composed actually needs.
    *
    * Why this exists: the ambient [[AnimationClock]] is what makes `spinner`, `marquee`, `indeterminateBar` and a timed
    * `Effect` animate with no counter to thread through — but the ticks that advance it used to come only from a
    * globally configured `config.tickRate`. An app that rendered a spinner and set no tick rate got a frozen spinner
    * and no diagnostic at all. Meanwhile an app that *did* set one paid for a tick every interval forever, whether or
    * not anything on screen was moving.
    *
    * Both are the same missing negotiation, and the render pass already knows the answer: every ambient animation reads
    * the clock, and each read says how often it needs one. So after each frame this asks for the shortest interval
    * anything on it wanted — plus a tick for the live toasts and post-render effects, which age in clock time and are
    * not part of the tree — and retargets a single `Async.every`. Nothing animated on the frame means no ticker at all.
    *
    * An app that configured a `tickRate` keeps being driven by the runner, exactly as before: this does nothing at all
    * for such a run, so `onTick` and the frame cadence of every existing app are untouched. `onTick` is deliberately
    * *not* called from the ambient tick either — it is documented as requiring a `config.tickRate`, and an app that
    * never asked for ticks should not suddenly start receiving them.
    *
    * Runs on the render thread, at the end of the render pass, which is where `Async.every` must be armed for its body
    * to come back to this loop.
    *
    * One limit worth knowing. A tick arrives as a task queued back to the render loop, and a loop with no configured
    * `tickRate` blocks on input for up to 100ms between draining that queue — so an ambient animation advances at that
    * granularity however short an interval it asked for. That is the difference between "the spinner spins" and "the
    * spinner is perfectly smooth"; an app that wants the second still sets `config.tickRate`.
