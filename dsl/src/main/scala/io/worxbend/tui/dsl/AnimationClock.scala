/** The ambient time source the animated elements read, so showing a spinner needs no tick plumbing at all.
  *
  * Before this existed, an animation cost four separate steps: set a `tickRate`, declare a `Signal[Int]`, override
  * `onTick` to advance it, and thread the counter through every call site. All four were boilerplate the framework
  * already had the information to do itself.
  *
  * Reading it is a *tracked* read, which is what makes this work rather than merely shorten: a view only subscribes to
  * the clock when it actually renders an animation, so a screen with no spinner on it is not woken up by the ticks —
  * where a hand-rolled `ticks.get` in the view repaints the whole app forever whether anything is moving or not.
  *
  * **One signal per render loop, one shared origin.** The value is elapsed time since the process started rather than
  * since a particular runner, so it is meaningful without a runner (a plain unit test reads `Duration.Zero` until
  * something advances it) and two runners in one JVM agree on what time it is. The `Signal` carrying it, however, is
  * per render loop, resolved through [[RenderThread.capture]] on every read and every advance. It has to be: a
  * `Signal`'s subscriber set is a plain mutable set with no lock, confined to *a* render thread — and with one signal
  * for the whole process, two runners' render threads both subscribe to and notify it at once. `checkRenderThread`
  * cannot catch that, because both threads *are* render threads. What it cost was measurable and silent: with the
  * shared signal put back, the regression test below — two loops, 2000 tracked reads each — sees one loop lose every
  * one of its 2000 subscriptions. An app whose only reactive dependency is the ambient clock (any `spinner`,
  * `orbitSpinner` or `indeterminateBar`) therefore froze mid-animation, with no exception to explain it.
  *
  * A caller belonging to no runner resolves the one shared unattributed loop, so plain unit tests and [[freezeAt]]
  * still see a single clock between them.
  *
  * **Reading the clock also asks for the ticks that advance it.** Each read records the interval the caller needs
  * against the loop's current frame, and `TuiApp` turns one repeating tick on at the shortest interval anything on the
  * frame asked for — and off again when a frame asks for nothing. That is why a `spinner` spins in an app that
  * configured no `tickRate` at all, and why an app showing no animation costs no ticks. An app that *did* set
  * `config.tickRate` keeps being driven by the runner exactly as before; the demand is then simply not consulted.

    * the caller is already a render thread, but queues it otherwise — and a test thread that belongs to no runner, in a
    * JVM where some other suite has one, queues onto a detached loop drained by whichever render thread reaches it
    * first. Returning before the queued body ran would leave the very next rendered frame pinned to the *old* value,
