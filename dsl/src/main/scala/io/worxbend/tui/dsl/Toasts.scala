/** The transient notification stack behind [[TuiApp.notify]].
  *
  * One of these belongs to one [[TuiApp]] instance. Every method here runs on that app's render thread — `push` and
  * `dismissAll` from event handlers, `age` from the tick stage, `overlay` from the view evaluation — so the queue needs
  * no synchronisation of its own; the [[Signal]] it lives in enforces that with its own render-thread check.
  *
  * A toast's lifetime is clock time rather than a count of ticks. Ticks are what *notices* the expiry — a run arms its
  * own ambient tick for as long as a toast is live, so no `config.tickRate` is needed for a toast to disappear on its
  * own — but they no longer decide how long "three seconds" is, so the same `notify` call means the same thing in an
  * app that ticks every 20ms and one that ticks every 200ms.
  *
  * `now` is the clock, in nanoseconds, and is a parameter rather than a direct `System.nanoTime()` call so a test can
  * step a toast's expiry without waiting for wall-clock time to pass; `TuiApp` hands in the run's clock, which is the
  * system clock unless a `runWith` overrides it.
