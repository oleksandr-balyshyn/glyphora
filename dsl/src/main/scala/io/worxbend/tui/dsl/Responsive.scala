  *

  * out deliberately — a `Size => Element` builder still sees both axes, and short-but-wide terminals want a different
  * decision than narrow ones, so folding both into one band would hide the distinction rather than name it.
  *
  * The thresholds are the ones terminals actually cluster around: 80 columns is the historical default, 120 the common
  * width of a maximized modern window, and anything under 60 is a split pane or a phone-sized SSH session.

/** Resolves [[ResponsiveElement]] nodes against the frame size, before the focus pass runs.

  * Order matters and is the whole reason this is a separate pass rather than something an element does while rendering:
  * `FocusPass.focusKeys` derives the tab order from the tree, and `EventRouter` routes keys and clicks through it, so
  * the subtree a breakpoint selected has to be *in* the tree by the time those run. An element that picked its children
  * at render time would be invisible to both — focusable widgets inside it would never receive a Tab stop and clicks on
  * them would miss.
  *
  * A responsive node on a layer a modal covers has the branch it builds suppressed here as well — that layer's
  * suppression happened before the branch existed.
