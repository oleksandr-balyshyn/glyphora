/** Composes one frame of a [[View]] into a [[Buffer]], with no runner, no terminal and no event loop.
  *
  * A live frame is composed by `TuiApp`, which needs a `Runner` and a `Backend` underneath it. That is the right shape
  * for an application and the wrong shape for the two jobs this exists for: rendering a view to text from a plain unit
  * test, and letting an application export what a view *would* look like at a given size — a screen dump for a bug
  * report, a rendered README, a golden-frame fixture.
  *
  * It runs the same two passes a live frame does, in the same order — the responsive resolve, which lets a `responsive`
  * node pick its branch for the size, then the focus decoration — so an exported screen matches what an app would paint
  * at that size rather than approximating it. `SnapshotSpec` asserts that against a live `Pilot` run, which is what
  * keeps the two from drifting.
  *
  * What it deliberately is not: interactive or animated. There is no clock, so an animated element renders at whatever
  * position it computes for the elapsed time it is handed; reactive reads subscribe nothing, so nothing here will ever
  * ask for a redraw; and there is no focus *tracking*, only the one element named by `focusedKey` drawn as focused.
  *
  * Callable from any thread: it registers no render loop and writes no signal.

  /** Renders `view` into a fresh `size`-shaped buffer and hands the buffer back.

    * first focusable element in the tree, which is where a freshly started app puts focus; a key that matches nothing
    * falls back to the same place, rather than failing, because a snapshot's job is to render.
